# Deep Dives

Long-form technical writeups that don't fit the [Snippets](../snippets)/[Sample Scripts](../sample-scripts)
format — full investigations into a hard problem, including the wrong turns, the dead ends that were
still worth knowing about, and the final working result. Where [Recipes](../recipes) gives you a
building block, a Deep Dive gives you the reasoning that got there, so you can adapt the technique to a
different problem instead of just copy-pasting the end result.

## Available Deep Dives

- **[Building a Real Freecam](freecam)** — how to get genuine continuous analog stick and d-pad input
  into a Lua script (something no documented engine API provides), by hijacking the PDA widget's own
  input-handling event, and using it to drive a fully controllable detached flying camera.
- **[Overriding a Function](function-override)** — replacing a piece of the game's own logic instead of
  just reading/writing a value, worked through end to end: the original approach, three wrong turns, the
  fix that actually worked, and the general pattern for applying this technique elsewhere.
